# Raincloudplots: The Shiny App!
<br>
<br>
This is the official Raincloud plots shiny app, using the [ggrain package](https://github.com/njudd/ggrain). The shiny app can make rainclouds of single vectors of data, if you have a secound grouping column it can also group the raincloud by that. At the moment we do not support connecting lines with dots, if you would like to do this please use the [R package](https://github.com/njudd/ggrain) or [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/).

If you use the Shiny app, please cite the R package:
